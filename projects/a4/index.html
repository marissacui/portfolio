			<h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I chose the question: Are there patterns of misconduct?
            </p>
            <p>
                I purposely kept this question broad to explore various interpretations of "patterns" and "misconduct". These are words that are commonly heard, but often peopple are talking about different things. Does misconduct mean substantiated? What kind of "patterns" actually matter?

                High dismissal rate suggests there are no patterns of misconduct

				Design decisions and rationale
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
                    <strong>Emphasizing the blue’s: unsubstantiated or exonerated</strong><br>
                    <em>Score: +2.0</em><br>
                    The pie charts visually emphasize the dominance of the blue (unsubstantiated) and light blue (exonerated), reinforcing the idea that misconduct is rare. This is all unfiltered data and is very upfront about the dominance of complaint dismissal.
                </li>
				<li>
                    <strong>
                        Breaking out each allegation type
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: -1.0
                    </em><br>
                    I originally thought to do this because I noticed that dismissal was quite prevalent across allegation types, so I chose to do this to use a “sea of blue” to my advantage. However, I kind of regret this decision because it doesn’t add much to the argument; instead, it serves more as a distraction.
                </li>
				<li>
                    <strong>
                        Labeling “total” for each complaint category
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: -0.5
                    </em><br>
                    Similar to above, the total almost acts as a distraction and more or less serves a neutral purpose. However, I do feel like it gives a sense of higher transparency. Even so, information does not communicate any additional insight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Chart title of “no patterns of misconduct”
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: -2.0
                    </em><br>
                    I’m using the word “patterns” very lightly because while it should be referring to patterns over time, I’m hoping the repeated pattern of the pie charts might influence readers to make a snap judgment on agreeing with the message.                </li>

			<h2>Visualization 2</h2>
            <h3>
                Misconduct persists despite formal charges
            </h3>

            <figure>

			<h3>
				Design decisions and rationale
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
                    <strong>
                        Showing both complaints and dispositions over time for specific officers
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: +2.0
                    </em><br>
                    This choice effectively demonstrates patterns of repeat offenses. I wanted to show both substantiated complaints (top chart) and their outcomes (bottom chart) to provide a complete view of whether officers with multiple complaints were actually charged or faced consequences. I feel like this is pretty transparent and the data almost speaks for itself.
                </li>
				<li>
                    <strong>
                        Connected the dots to show the span over years
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: +1.0
                    </em><br>
                    By connecting the dots I was hoping to emphasize long-term patterns, making it visually clear which dots belong to which officer. This decision is generally earnest, but it slightly strengthens the argument in a way that could lead to over-interpretation (i.e. people might take away causality).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Highlighted the “charged” dispositions in red
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: +1.5
                    </em><br>
                    I deliberately used red to highlight cases where officers were formally charged, making it immediately clear when misconduct was considered serious enough to warrant discipline. While this choice is not misleading because it reflects real disciplinary actions, the yellow, less severe, dots do blend in.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Did not include average complaint rate for comparison                    
                    </strong><br>
                    <em>
                        Score: -1.0
                    </em><br>
                    I chose to only display officers with the highest complaint counts, without showing a comparison to the overall NYPD complaint rate. While this helps focus the narrative on repeat offenders, it does not indicate whether these officers are extreme outliers or part of a broader trend. If I had included an average line showing how many complaints the typical officer receives, it would help viewers better contextualize. However, I prioritized keeping the visualization clean and focused on the worst offenders rather than adding extra comparison elements.
                </ul>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>
                I found this exercise really challenging because it was easy to get into analysis paralysis. Every time I thought I could use certain data to deceive, my critical thinking kicked in, forcing me to question my own approach. I would spend another 30 minutes investigating the data to see if there was a better way to spin it, only to realize that the best deception is often subtle rather than blatant.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, I don’t even feel like I was particularly successful—especially in visualization 1. I relied heavily on distraction and making things unclear rather than crafting a strong deceptive thesis. The visualization was persuasive in guiding interpretation, but it didn’t feel like an outright manipulation of the data. Instead, it was more about controlling emphasis than actually changing the meaning of the data. I had an easier time with visualization 2, where patterns of misconduct were clearer. However, I ran into the problem of not overloading the visualization because there was a lot of interesting supporting evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I definitely felt challenged because I might’ve not quite figured out the boundary between ethical and non-ethical design. I wasn’t sure how much to push the data, so I wasn’t able to fulfill the extreme narratives. Data is not black and white, after all.
